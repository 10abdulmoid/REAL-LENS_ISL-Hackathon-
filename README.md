# REAL-LENS_ISL-Hackathon-
This repository contains the source code of our PROJECT REAL LENS
The Project aims at detecting the modern deepfakes made by MODERN GENERATATIVE AI MODELS. The project aims to predict the nature of the media (AUDIO,VIDEO,IMAGE) whether it is real or fake.
The accuracy of our Deepfake detection model is so high that it even detects the DEEPFAKES which looks real to human perception.
We aim to tackle every type of deepfake that a generative AI model can generate.

for IMAGES -  we use MobileVnet/RESnet to predict whether the image is spoofed or not.
for VIDEOS - we use Vision Transoformers to predict whether the Video is generated by AI or not.
for Audio - we use Wav2vec pre trained model developed by meta which is fine tuned on asvspoof19 dataset to increase its accuracy to detect AI generated Audio files.
